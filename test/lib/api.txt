Jasmine has several built-in matchers. Here are a few:

expect(x).toEqual(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are equivalent

expect(x).toBe(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are the same object

expect(x).toMatch(pattern); compares x to string or regular expression pattern and passes if they match

expect(x).toBeDefined(); passes if x is not undefined

expect(x).toBeUndefined(); passes if x is undefined

expect(x).toBeNull(); passes if x is null

expect(x).toBeTruthy(); passes if x evaluates to true

expect(x).toBeFalsy(); passes if x evaluates to false

expect(x).toContain(y); passes if array or string x contains y

expect(x).toBeLessThan(y); passes if x is less than y

expect(x).toBeGreaterThan(y); passes if x is greater than y

expect(function(){fn();}).toThrow(e); passes if function fn throws exception e when executed
